This tool enables users to summarize YouTube videos by providing a link to the video. It utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract the transcript of the video and generate a concise summary.

## Limitations

1. Please note that this tool only works with YouTube video URLs copied directly from the browser address bar. URLs obtained by clicking the "share" button on mobile devices may not be compatible.
